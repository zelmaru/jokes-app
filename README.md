Programming Jokes App

This project was created using Node.js, Express, EJS and Mongoose.
Users can register and log in using Facebook, Gmail or Email + Password.
Passwords are not stored directly in a database. They are encrypted using passport-local-mongoose.
The app is using cookies and sessions.
For input validation, express-validator is used.

Features:

On the main page, All posted jokes from all users are listed.
On the "random joke" page, a random joke is displayed using Javascript.
Authentificated users can post jokes and edit or delete them afterwards.
Users can sign up for newsletter (Mailchimp API).
Users can send me an e-mail using a contact form (built using nodemailer).

If you spot a bug or have some suggestions to improve the app, feel free to contribute
